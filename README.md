As part of Computer Science and Engineering Society, NIT Warangal, we have developed the CrypticHunt Capture The Flag event for our Technozion fest.

![CrypticHunt](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0eccefa8-373a-4fc3-a380-9bbb2587769f)

Consisting of a terminal, players have to use basic linux commands (`cd`, `ls`, `grep`, `find`, `cat`, `|`) to find flags and proceed up the levels of the game.<br><br>
