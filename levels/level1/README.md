## Task
1. There are 10 folders each with files and folders with repetitive names
2. Do `ls` in the main directory but this time with flags such as -a and -R and -l
3. Find a file with the name "this file has spaces in the name" which is non executable
4. `cat` the flag stored in one file out of 3 which has the flag stored as `#FLAG{}$`

## Hints which can be provided
- `man` page of `ls`

## Implementation
System should be able to parse flags and file names with spaces and special characters
